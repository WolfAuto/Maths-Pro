# Maths-Pro

Maths Pro is a program which allows students and teachers to register with different areas through using a database made using sqlite3 an various other python modules 

The maths questions will be stored in the database and called from it when the user are doing questions which will continue until the user decide to stop when the user stops a pop up box detailing there progress will be shown and this information will be stored in a database connected to student.

Students have options of doing math questions, view account information and viewing maths information. When a student logs in they will also be able to see any upcoming tests they may have 

While doing the questions student will gain and lose marks which will be stored over time 

Teachers have options of view student/class information, setting test dates, viewing flagged students and viewing account informatino

Teachers will be able to view all student information and be able to see a graph of progression of all students as well as any students who have gotten to many questions wrong in which case they will come up as flagged students so that intervention can be put in place to help them.

This is a program development for my computer science controlled assessment feel free to use it to implement in a different way.

This is a working progress feel free to edit and change the code
